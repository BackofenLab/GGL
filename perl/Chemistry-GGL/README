Chemistry-GGL version 0.01
==========================

This is a simple Perl xs interface to GGL. Please refer to the top level
README for details on the GGL itself.

It is NOT meant to be distributed separately from the GGL sources, since
it depends on the sources being present during compile time.

INSTALLATION

Before you can compile and install this module, you will need to
./configure && make the GGL itself in the directory you've unpacked it.
You don't need to install it, because all the necessary object files are
linked statically into the Perl module.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Chemistry::Mol
  Chemistry::File::SMILES

  (optional) Chemistry::ReactionGrammar::File::GML
