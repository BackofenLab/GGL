\section{Molecular groups}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter explains how to define molecular groups in term of the Graph
Modeling Language (\GML{}) and how to use them. Therein, molecular groups are
defined by an undirected graph where each node represents a single atom and
edges correspond to bonds of a given valence. Within the \GGL{}, we assume node
and edge labels to be conform with the SMILES notation.

alphabetic order.
% Keys underlayed with the color gray are only relevant when defining components

\subsection{Visualization}
\label{ss:molcomp2svg}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \GML{} definition of molecular components can become quite large and hard to
read. To ease their creation and to allow for a simple evaluation, the \GGL{}
sports the visualization script \molcompsvg{} within its Perl module.

Given a molecular component in \GML{} notation, the script produces a graphical
depiction in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. Therein, compID nodes are
highlighted in red. An example is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:NADH-groups}c).

The \molcompsvg{} script uses the \texttt{OpenBabel} package to create the 2D
depictions of the molecules and thus requires its presence.

\section{Molecular groups within SMILES}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\def\NAD{NAD$^{+}$}
\def\NADH{NADH}


One field of application for the definition and use of molecular groups is the
specification of molecules that differ only in a few atoms or bonds. In such
cases, it can be convinient to specify only the dissimilar parts of the
molecules and to use group placeholders for the equal parts. That way, the
similarity becomes easy to see and the SMILES easier to read.

  \caption{The molecules \NADH{} (left) and \NAD{} (right).}
  \label{fig:NADH}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


As an example, we use the molecules \NADH{} and \NAD{} depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:NADH} sporting 66 and 65 atoms, respectively. The difference
basically comprises only an additional proton within \NADH{} and a charge change
within the lower ring while the rest of the molecules are identically. Note, these two
changes alter the ring from non-aromatic (\NADH) to aromatic (\NAD).

Minimal SMILES encodings of the molecules (highlighting the differing ring in
red) are

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent\verb|NC(=O)|{\color{red}\verb|C1[CH2]C=CN(C=1|)}\verb|C2OC(COP(O)(=O)O..|\\
\noindent\verb|    ..P(O)(=O)OCC3OC(C(O)C3O)n4cnc5c(N)ncnc54)C(O)C2O|
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\noindent for \NADH{} and 

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent\verb|NC(=O)|{\color{red}\verb|c1ccc[n+](c1)|}\verb|C2OC(COP(O)(=O)O..|\\
\noindent\verb|    ..P(O)(=O)OCC3OC(C(O)C3O)n4cnc5c(N)ncnc54)C(O)C2O|
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\noindent for \NAD{}.

In contrast, when using group declarations for the identical parts, namely the
CONH2 group and the ribo-adenosine, the SMILES shrinks to 

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent\verb|[{CONH2}]|{\color{red}\verb|C1[CH2]C=CN(C=1)|}\verb|[{Ribo-ADP}]|
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\noindent for \NADH{} and 

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent\verb|[{CONH2}]|{\color{red}\verb|c1ccc[n+](c1)|}\verb|[{Ribo-ADP}]|
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\noindent for \NAD{}, both depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:NADH-groups}a) and~b).

  information is given; all other carbons have one not depicted adjacent
  proton. (c) Depiction of the \texttt{\{CONH2\}} group using the script
  \molcompsvg{}. Note, the proxy node is highlighted in red.}
  \label{fig:NADH-groups}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


In the following, we give the GML encoding of the \verb|{CONH2}| group. An
according depiction, using the \molcompsvg{} visualization script, is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:NADH-groups}c).

\startGML
\begin{verbatim}
molcomp [
  description "{CONH2}"
  compIDs [ id 0 ]
  node [ id 0 label "C" ]
  node [ id 1 label "O" ]
  node [ id 2 label "N" ]
  node [ id 3 label "H" ]
  node [ id 4 label "H" ]
  edge [ source 0 target 1 label "=" ]
  edge [ source 0 target 2 label "-" ]
  edge [ source 2 target 3 label "-" ]
  edge [ source 2 target 4 label "-" ]
]
\end{verbatim}
\endGML


Note, both the \verb|{CONH2}| as well as the \verb|{Ribo-ADP}| group are
molecule components that are interfacing via a single node with the remaining
molecule. This enables the representation within SMILES as a complex pseudo atom
in bracket notation namely \verb|[{CONH2}]| or \verb|[{Ribo-ADP}]|, resp., as
done within the shorted SMILES strings presented above. This node is specified
using the \texttt{compIDs} entry within the GML definition. Therefore, a
molecular group to be used within molecule representations is only allowed to
sport \emph{exactly one \texttt{compID} entry} naming the proxy node of the
component. During the SMILES parsing, the complex pseudo atom is replaced withthe proxy node of the according group and the remaining group atoms and bondsare added to the molecule.

\section{Molecular groups within graph rewrite rules}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The specification of (bio)chemical reactions often requires the representation
of large (unchanged) parts of molecules in order to make the rule as specific as
the chemical reaction. A classic example is the involvement of helper molecules
like ATP, \NADH{}, etc. that are only slightly changed but have to be
represented completely to avoid the application of the rule using similar molecules.

To this end, the \GGL{} supports the specification of molecular groups as
pseudo-atoms within chemical rule definitions. They allow for a much
easier and compact rule definition and avoid potential typos and mistakes.

As an example consider the lactat-dehyrogenase from the citrat-cycle given by
\NAD{} + lactate $\rightarrow$ \NADH{} + pyruvate. \NADH{} is a large
molecule comprising 66 atoms. Thus, a complete specification would require the
definition of all \NADH{} atoms and bonds together with the according parts
of lactate and pyruvate incorporating 76 atoms in total. Furthermore, this would be
the case for all other \NADH-dependent reactions as well.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\builddir/Figures/lactat-dehydrogenase}
  \caption{Lactat-dehydrogenase : \NAD{} + lactate $\rightarrow$
  \NADH{} + pyruvate. The picture exemplifies the use of group identifiers to compact
  the rule specification. The colors indicate if specified as context (black),
  left (red), or right (green). Note, such a representation reduces the rule
  specification from 76 to only 23 atoms.}
  \label{fig:lactat-dehydrogenase}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Using group identifiers, the definition of the lactat-dehydrogenase becomes much
more compact as exemplified in Fig.~\ref{fig:lactat-dehydrogenase}. With only 23
atoms, the whole reaction is described. Note, the rule specification uses two
group descriptors. Each is replaced during the rule \GML{} parsing with
according molecule components/subgraphs, i.e. \texttt{\{CONH2\}} is replaced
with a \cee{CONH2} group (see Fig.~\ref{fig:NADH-groups}) and
\texttt{\{Ribo-ADP\}} with a ribose and attached adenosine.

\emph{Note:} group identifier are only allowed within context or for label
changes within both left/right at once. The reason is: each group shows as
interface \emph{exactly one proxy node} that will replace the specified pseudo
atom labeled with the group ID. Thus, a rule can only change bonds with the
proxy node! The rest of the group is statically added to the \emph{rule
context}. It is possible to specify label changes of the proxy node atom but
these are restricted to charge changes as exemplified below. An explicit change
of the proxy node label (e.g. make it aromatic ``\texttt{C}'' $\rightarrow$
``\texttt{c}'') is not possible!

\startGML
\begin{verbatim}
rule [
# example of charge change of a groups proxy node
# the rest of the group is added to the rule's context
	left [
	  node [ id 0 label "{GROUP}+" ]
	  ..
	]
..
	right [
	  node [ id 0 label "{GROUP}" ]
	  ..
	]
]

\end{verbatim}
\endGML
