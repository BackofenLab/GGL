 *
 * <center> GGL - @VERSION@ </center>
 *
 * This document provides reference information about the 
 * <A HREF="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/">Graph Grammar Library</A>.
 * 
 * \section SecGoals The goal
 * 
 * This C++ programming library provides a platform for the formulation and
 * application of context sensitive graph grammars on arbitrary labeled graphs.
 * 
 * It is split into several sub-libraries to achieve a high level of modularity.
 * 
 * \section SecLibs Libraries
 * 
 * \subsection SubSecGGL GGL - Graph Grammar Library
 * 
 * The GGL collects the necessary interfaces and core functionalities to enable
 * the formulation of graph grammar rules and their application.
 * Therefore, the algorithms use the sgm::Graph_Interface to
 * enable the independence of the concrete graph implementation used. 
 * The rule definition is currently based on BGL graphs which allows for a 
 * high level of flexibility (see \ref SecDependencies)
 * All classes and functions are templated to maintain the flexibility of the
 * boost graphs.
 * 
 * The GGL is extended by the GGL-CHEM library (see \ref SubSecGGLCHEM) for
 * the application of graph grammars to chemical molecules and reactions.
 * 
 * The application of graph grammar rules is based on the detection of 
 * subgraph isomorphisms. This is done using the SGM library.
 * 
 * \subsection SubSecSGM SGM - Subgraph Matching Library
 * 
 * The SGM library provides a generic interface for graph or subgraph isomorphism 
 * algorithms. A graph handled by the SGM has to implement the 
 * sgm::Graph_Interface. A templated wrapper class for BGL graphs is provided.
 * Furthermore, graphs that serve as patterns have to provide the extended
 * sgm::Pattern_Interface interface.
 * 
 * A first implementation of a subgraph matcher is done based on the VF2 library.
 * The VF2 algorithm is the state-of-the-art algorithm for this objective.
 * We integrated the VF2 library source into the package to reduce the 
 * dependencies of the package. See the vflib2* folder in the source directory.
 * 
 * \subsection SubSecGGLCHEM GGL-CHEM - GGL Chemistry
 * 
 * This library extends the GGL with classes to represent chemical molecules as
 * BGL graphs. The molecules are read and written in the standard Daylight's 
 * SMILES format. The graph grammar rules specify valid chemical reactions that
 * modify molecules.
 * 
 * \subsection SubSecTools GGL Tools	
 * 
 * Based on the GGL we have set up several tools for a direct application of the
 * library.
 * 
 * - toyChem : iterative simulation of chemical reactions using GGL-CHEM
 * 
 * 
 *
 * 
 * \section SecDependencies Dependencies
 * 
 * The GGL depends on the following libraries:
 * 
 * - the <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/graph/"> BGL - Boost Graph Library </A> (version >= 1.36.0)
 *
 * Optionally one can extend the function volume of GGL-CHEM using
 *
 * - the <A HREF="http://openbabel.org"> OpenBabel - The Open Source Chemistry Toolbox</A> (optional and version >= 2.2.0)
 *
 * 
 * \section SecApp Appendix
 * 
 * Additionally, the documentation also features the following parts:
 *  - \ref PageInstallation
 *  - \ref PageTests
 *

/**
 * \page PageInstallation Installation
 * 
 * Follow this steps to create a local version of the GGL:
 * 
 * - download and unzip the 
 *   <A HREF="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/"> GGL source package </A> 
 *   distribution
 * 
 * - run "./configure --help" to get an overview of further possible parameters
 * - run "./configure" with your desired parameters to generate the Makefiles
 * - "make" to generate the library
 * 
 * - "make test" to test if everything works fine (if not please report)
 * 
 * - "make install" to install the headers and library to the given directory
 * 
 * - "make doc" to generate the html documentation (if selected during the
 *   configure call)
 * - "make doxygen-doc" to generate the whole documentation
 *
 * See the file INSTALL in the library root path for further informations.
 * 
 */
 
/**
 * \page PageTests Test cases and usage examples
 * 
 * To check if the GGL does function as expected a set of tests was implemented
 * for each non-abstracted class. 
 * 
 * The source code can be used as an example for the usage of the GGL-classes.
 * 
 * All files can be found in a subfolder named "tests" in the GGL root
 * directory. They are named in the format "testCLASSNAME.cc".
